Changes in version next

 * `maximumBy` now behaves like its counterpart in `Data.List` in that if
   `maximumBy` has to choose between several elements which could be
   considered the maximum, it will now choose the last element (previously,
   it would choose the first element). Similarly, `maxIndexBy` will also
   now pick the last element if several elements could be considered the
   maximum.
 * The `Mutable` type family is now injective on GHC 8.0 or later.
 * Using empty `Storable` vectors no longer results in division-by-zero
   errors.
 * The `Data` instances for `Vector` types now have well defined
   implementations for `toConstr`, `gunfold`, and `dataTypeOf`.
 * New function: `partitionWith`.
 * Add `Unbox` instances for `Identity`, `Const`, `Down`, `Dual`, `Sum`,
   `Product`, `Min`, `Max`, `First`, `Last`, `WrappedMonoid`, `Arg`, `Any`,
   `All`, `Alt`, and `Compose`.
 * Add `NFData1` instances for applicable `Vector` types.

Changes in version 0.12.0.1

 * Make sure `length` can be inlined
 * Include modules that test-suites depend on in other-modules

Changes in version 0.12.0.0

 * Documentation fixes/additions
 * New functions: createT, iscanl/r, iterateNM, unfoldrM, uniq
 * New instances for various vector types: Semigroup, MonadZip
 * Made `Storable` vectors respect memory alignment
 * Changed some macros to ConstraintKinds
   - Dropped compatibility with old GHCs to support this
 * Add `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Show1`, and `Read1` `Vector` instances, and related
   helper functions.
 * Relax context for `Unbox (Complex a)`.

Changes in version 0.11.0.0

 * Define `Applicative` instances for `Data.Vector.Fusion.Util.{Box,Id}`
