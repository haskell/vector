# Dependence on random numbers.

These benchmarks depend on random numbers which are by default generated using a static seed.

To avoid misleading results:
* Run the benchmarks using the static seed for a first approximation.
* Verify the results by running the benchmark with different seeds.

Seeds can be changed in `Main.useSeed`.
