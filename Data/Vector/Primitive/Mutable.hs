-- Growing
-- -------

-- | Grow a primitive vector by the given number of elements. The number must be
-- non-negative. Same semantics as in `G.grow` for generic vector.
--
-- ====__Examples__
--
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector.Primitive as VP
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector.Primitive.Mutable as MVP
-- >>> mv <- VP.thaw $ VP.fromList ([10, 20, 30] :: [Int])
-- >>> mv' <- MVP.grow mv 2
--
-- Extra memory at the end of the newly allocated vector is initialized to 0
-- bytes, which for `Prim` instance will usually correspond to some default
-- value for a particular type, eg. @0@ for @Int@, @\NUL@ for @Char@,
-- etc. However, if `unsafeGrow` was used instead this would not have been
-- guaranteed and some garbage would be there instead:
--
-- >>> VP.unsafeFreeze mv'
-- [10,20,30,0,0]
--
-- Having the extra space we can write new values in there:
--
-- >>> MVP.write mv' 3 999
-- >>> VP.unsafeFreeze mv'
-- [10,20,30,999,0]
--
-- It is important to note that the source mutable vector is not affected when
-- the newly allocated one is mutated.
--
-- >>> MVP.write mv' 2 888
-- >>> VP.unsafeFreeze mv'
-- [10,20,888,999,0]
-- >>> VP.unsafeFreeze mv
-- [10,20,30]
