-- --------------

-- | Create a mutable vector of the given length.

{-# INLINE new #-}

--
-- @since 0.5

{-# INLINE generate #-}

-- | /O(n)/ Create a mutable vector of the given length (0 if the length is

-- Growing
-- -------

-- | Grow an unboxed vector by the given number of elements. The number must be
-- non-negative. Same semantics as in `G.grow` for generic vector.
--
-- ====__Examples__
--
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed as VU
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed.Mutable as MVU
-- >>> mv <- VU.thaw $ VU.fromList ([('a', 10), ('b', 20), ('c', 30)] :: [(Char, Int)])
-- >>> mv' <- MVU.grow mv 2
--
-- Extra memory at the end of the newly allocated vector is initialized to 0
-- bytes, which for `Unbox` instance will usually correspond to some default
-- value for a particular type, eg. @0@ for @Int@, @False@ for @Bool@,
-- etc. However, if `unsafeGrow` was used instead this would not have been
-- guaranteed and some garbage would be there instead:
--
-- >>> VU.unsafeFreeze mv'
-- [('a',10),('b',20),('c',30),('\NUL',0),('\NUL',0)]
--
-- Having the extra space we can write new values in there:
--
-- >>> MVU.write mv' 3 ('d', 999)
-- >>> VU.unsafeFreeze mv'
-- [('a',10),('b',20),('c',30),('d',999),('\NUL',0)]
--
-- It is important to note that the source mutable vector is not affected when
-- the newly allocated one is mutated.
--
-- >>> MVU.write mv' 2 ('X', 888)
-- >>> VU.unsafeFreeze mv'
-- [('a',10),('b',20),('X',888),('d',999),('\NUL',0)]
-- >>> VU.unsafeFreeze mv
-- [('a',10),('b',20),('c',30)]
