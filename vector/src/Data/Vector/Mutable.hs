-- Growing
-- -------

-- | Grow a boxed vector by the given number of elements. The number must be
-- non-negative. This has the same semantics as 'G.grow' for generic vectors. It differs
-- from @grow@ functions for unpacked vectors, however, in that only pointers to
-- values are copied over, therefore the values themselves will be shared between the
-- two vectors. This is an important distinction to know about during memory
-- usage analysis and in case the values themselves are of a mutable type, e.g.
-- 'Data.IORef.IORef' or another mutable vector.
--
-- ==== __Examples__
--
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector as V
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector.Mutable as MV
-- >>> mv <- V.thaw $ V.fromList ([10, 20, 30] :: [Integer])
-- >>> mv' <- MV.grow mv 2
--
-- The two extra elements at the end of the newly allocated vector will be
-- uninitialized and will result in an error if evaluated, so me must overwrite
-- them with new values first:
--
-- >>> MV.write mv' 3 999
-- >>> MV.write mv' 4 777
-- >>> V.freeze mv'
-- [10,20,30,999,777]
--
-- It is important to note that the source mutable vector is not affected when
-- the newly allocated one is mutated.
--
-- >>> MV.write mv' 2 888
-- >>> V.freeze mv'
-- [10,20,888,999,777]
-- >>> V.freeze mv
-- [10,20,30]
