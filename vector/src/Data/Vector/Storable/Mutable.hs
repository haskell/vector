--
-- ==== __Examples__
--
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector.Storable as VS
-- >>> import qualified Data.Vector.Storable.Mutable as MVS
-- >>> mv <- VS.thaw $ VS.fromList ([10, 20, 30] :: [Int])
-- >>> mv' <- MVS.grow mv 2
--
-- Extra memory at the end of the newly allocated vector is initialized to 0
-- bytes, which for 'Storable' instances will usually correspond to some default
-- value for a particular type, e.g. @0@ for @Int@, @False@ for @Bool@,
-- etc. However, if 'unsafeGrow' was used instead, this would not have been
-- guaranteed and some garbage would be there instead.
--
-- >>> VS.freeze mv'
-- [10,20,30,0,0]
--
-- Having the extra space we can write new values in there:
--
-- >>> MVS.write mv' 3 999
-- >>> VS.freeze mv'
-- [10,20,30,999,0]
--
-- It is important to note that the source mutable vector is not affected when
-- the newly allocated one is mutated.
--
-- >>> MVS.write mv' 2 888
-- >>> VS.freeze mv'
-- [10,20,888,999,0]
