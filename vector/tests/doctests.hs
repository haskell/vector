import Test.DocTest (doctest)

-- Doctests are weirdly fragile. For example running tests for module
-- A (D.V.Unboxed.Base) could cause tests in unrelated woudle B
-- (D.V.Storable) to start failing with weird errors.
--
-- In order to avoid this one would want to run doctests with
-- per-module granularity but this cause another sort of problems!
-- When we load only single module and use import doctests then some
-- data types may come from built library and some from ghci session.
--
-- This could be remedied by running doctests for groups of modules.
-- This _is_ convoluted setup but doctests now works for GHC9.4
